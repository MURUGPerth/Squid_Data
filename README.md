# Southern Calamari 
##(<i>Sepioteuthis australis<i/>) 

This dataset is from a research project at Murdoch Univeristy, carried out by Peter Coulson and Jake Chandler, in conjuction with the Department of Fisheries of Western Australia.  

The data is a very comprehensive biological assay of the Southern Calamari of Western Australia.

The samples were collected from various locations, every month for 2 years. Once the specimens were collected, bioligcal data was measured and recorded. Variables which were recorded include:
* Date and Site data
* Method of Capture
* Fish ID number
* Biological Data:
 * Hood length (HL)
 * Mantle width (Width)
 * Whole Weight
 * Mantle Weight
 * Quill Length *see picture below
* Reproductive data:
 * Sex
 * Gonad Stage
 * Gonad Weight
    * Ovary / Testes Weight
    * Sperm / Oocyte Weight

###Underlying question and task
* To investigate the reprodutive cycles of the Southern Calamari
* To find out where the spawning locations of the Southern Calamari 
* Investigate the maturation of the Southern Calamari

###Analysis:  
* Calculate the Gonadosomatic Index, defined as:   
  * (Gonad Weight / Whole Weight) * 100  

* Calculate the Sex Ratio, defined as:  
  * (Number of Males / Number of Females) * 100  

* Plot the Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) as a time series, contrasting between males and females for each sampling region
* Plot the Gonad Stage as a time series, contrasting between males and females for each sampling region
* Compare the mean weight (using fresh, mantle weight) between males and females (t test)
* Compare the mean weight (using fresh, mantle weight) of Southern Calamari over time, using simple linear regression
* Compare the mean length (using quill length) between males and females (t test)
* Compare the mean length (using quill length) of Southern Calamari over time, using simple linear regression
